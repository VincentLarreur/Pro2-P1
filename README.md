UDC Practica 1 List Programacion 2

Implementation of the counting system for the electronic voting machines that will be used in the polling stations during the next elections. The system will take account of the different political parties that have received votes in a certain polling station, the number of votes given to each party, the amount of null votes and the turnout. The system must also allow for making parties illegal.

The aim of this work is to practise the concept of independence of implementation in the case of Abstract Data Types (ADTs). The student is asked to create two different implementations of an UNORDERED LIST, a STATIC implementation and a DYNAMIC implementation, which must work in a fully interchangeable way. So, the main program must not make any assumptions about the way an ADT is implemented.


Implementation:
---------------------
[X] - Done
[ ] - Not yet

[ ] Static List:

	[x]create empty list
	[x]isEmptyList
	[x]first
	[x]last
	[x]next
	[x]previous
	[x]insertItem
	[x]deleteAtPosition
	[x]getItem
	[x]updateVotes
	[x]findItem
  
[x] Dynamic List:

	[x]create empty list
	[x]isEmptyList
	[x]first
	[x]last
	[x]next
	[x]previous
	[x]insertItem
	[x]deleteAtPosition
	[x]getItem
	[x]updateVotes
	[x]findItem
