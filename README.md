UDC Practica 1 List Programacion 2

This second practical exercise consists in extending the features of the system, which will be now in charge of managing several polling stations simultaneously. The system will be responsible for keeping an updated vote count of all the voting centers (i.e. the polling stations) and for showing electoral statistics about them. For this purpose, several data structures will be used.

The aim of this work is to understand how several abstract data types (ADTs) work, how they can be implemented and how the interdependencies between them can be managed.
